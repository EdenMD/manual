# Website to APK Converter

This repository provides a template for converting a web application into an Android APK using Apache Cordova and automating the build process with GitHub Actions.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Automatic APK Generation**: Every push to the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds an Android APK.
*   **Apache Cordova Integration**: Utilizes Cordova to wrap your web content into a native Android application.
*   **Customizable Web Content**: Easily update your website by modifying files in the `www/` directory.
*   **Release Builds**: Generates unsigned release APKs, suitable for testing or manual signing for distribution.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
website-to-apk/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ www/                  # Your web application files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # The entry point of your web app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.xml            # Cordova configuration file (app name, ID, version, plugins)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build-apk.yml # GitHub Actions workflow for building the APK
```

*   **`www/`**: This directory contains all your website's static files. When the Android app launches, it loads `www/index.html` in an embedded web view.
*   **`config.xml`**: This XML file is crucial for Cordova. It defines your application's metadata (e.g., `id` as the package name like `com.example.myapp`, `version`, `name`), permissions, features, and the plugins to be included in the native build.
*   **`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`**: This YAML file defines the GitHub Actions workflow. It specifies the steps to set up the build environment, install Cordova, add the Android platform, build the APK, and upload it as an artifact.

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Develop Your Web App**: Place all your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web assets inside the `www/` directory.
2.  **Configure Cordova**: Adjust `config.xml` to set your app's name, ID, version, and any other Cordova-specific settings or plugins.
3.  **Push to GitHub**: Commit your changes and push them to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
4.  **GitHub Actions Trigger**: The `build-apk.yml` workflow automatically starts.
5.  **Build Process**: The workflow:
    *   Checks out your code.
    *   Installs Node.js and the Cordova CLI.
    *   Uses Cordova to add the Android platform, effectively creating a native Android project around your web content and `config.xml` settings.
    *   Compiles the native Android project into an `.apk` file.
6.  **Download APK**: Once the workflow completes successfully, you can navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository, select the latest run, and download the generated `.apk` file from the "Artifacts" section.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd website-to-apk
    ```
2.  **Add Your Web Content**: Replace the contents of the `www/` directory with your own web application files.
3.  **Customize `config.xml`**: Update the `id`, `version`, `name`, `description`, and `author` elements in `config.xml` to match your application's details.
4.  **Push Changes**: Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit with my web app"
    git push origin main
    ```
5.  **Monitor Build**: Go to the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repository to watch the build progress and download your APK.

## üîë Signing Your APK (Important for Distribution)

The APK generated by GitHub Actions is an **unsigned release build**. For distribution on the Google Play Store or other app markets, you **must** sign your APK with your own keystore.

**To sign your APK manually:**

1.  **Generate a Keystore**: If you don't have one, create a keystore using Java's `keytool`:
    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
    ```
2.  **Sign the APK**: Use `apksigner` (from the Android SDK build-tools) to sign your APK:
    ```bash
    apksigner sign --ks my-release-key.keystore --ks-key-alias my-key-alias --in YOUR_APP_NAME.apk --out YOUR_APP_NAME-signed.apk
    ```
    You will be prompted for your keystore and key alias passwords.
3.  **Optimize (Optional but Recommended)**: Use `zipalign` (also from Android SDK build-tools) to optimize your signed APK:
    ```bash
    zipalign -v 4 YOUR_APP_NAME-signed.apk YOUR_APP_NAME-final.apk
    ```

For more details on signing, refer to the [Android Developers documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).

## üîå Further Customization (Cordova Plugins, Icons, Splash Screens)

*   **Cordova Plugins**: To add native device features (camera, geolocation, AdMob, etc.), you'll need to install Cordova plugins. You can add them locally using `cordova plugin add <plugin-id>` and then commit the changes. The workflow will automatically include them.
*   **Icons and Splash Screens**: Refer to the [Cordova documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/images.html) on how to add custom app icons and splash screens by placing image files and updating `config.xml`.
